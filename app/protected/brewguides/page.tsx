      "The Chemex is a popular pour-over brewing device known for producing a clean, clear, and balanced cup of coffee. You use a thick paper filter which captures a lot of oils and small particles, making the coffee taste smooth and crisp. It's ideal for a medium-coarse grind and requires careful pouring of water in a circular motion to ensure even extraction. A Chemex brew usually takes 4 minutes, producing a bright and flavorful coffee.",
